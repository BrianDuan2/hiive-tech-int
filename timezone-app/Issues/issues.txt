Issues
1 - I am able to delete the "You" record
Expected Result: The user should not be able to delete the "You" row from the table
Actual Result: Pressing delete on the "You" row deletes the record

2 - Timezones are sorted incorrectly
Expected Result: Timezones should be sorted with earliest time first and latest time last 
Actual Result: Timezones are instead sorted in alphabetical order of name, with the "You" record always at the top

3 - Creating a record with a selected timezone that has an existing record replaces that record instead of creating a new one
Expected Result: **Need to check requirements** Assuming that a new record should be created instead of replace the label on the old one
Actual result: The label on the existing record is replaced, this can occur with the "You" record as well

4 - The app only has 6 timezones available

5 - Creating an extremely long label (i.e "wwwwwwwwww...") breaks the ui
Expected Result: Name should be shortened with "..." or similar
Actual Result: Timezone and Local Time columns are push out of the table dimensions

6 - Local Time shown does not update in real time
Expected Result: When time advances to the next minute, so should the value shown in the app
Actual Result: The value in the app does not update until the user clicks on an element (Add timezone, delete button, etc.)

7 - Unhandled runtime error (think this one is just an error with my Node.js configuration but including it just in case)
Actual Result: Runtime error shows when trying to refresh the page
